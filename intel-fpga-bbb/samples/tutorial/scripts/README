install.sh:

  This script clones the OPAE SDK and BBB repositories and installs OPAE
  and the MPF building blocks software to /usr/local.  The script assumes
  that either ModelSim or VCS is already installed.  The script should work
  in any Linux system and may be used to set up the tutorial environment in
  the tutorial virtual machine image.

  To use this script inside the tutorial virtual machine:

    1.  Download the image from <> and follow the instructions to install it
        in the enclosed README file.

    2.  In a shell inside the virtual machine:
        > wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OPAE/intel-fpga-bbb/master/samples/tutorial/scripts/install.sh
        > chmod a+x install.sh
        > ./install.sh


  install.sh is interactive, stopping to enumerate each major step.  You
  can skip the interactive prompts by piping "yes" into the script, i.e.:
  "yes | ./install.sh".  Some of the installation steps in the script
  require root access.  You may be prompted by sudo.  The account and
  password in the tutorial virtual machine are both "fpga".

  The tutorial depends on some environment variables configured by
  install.sh in ~/.bash_opae_env. After running install.sh, either "source
  ~/.bash_opae_env" or exit the installation shell and start a new one,
  where the script will be loaded automatically.

  Once OPAE and the BBB packages are installed, change your working
  directory to ~/src/intel-fpga-bbb/samples/tutorial and begin with the
  README file.
